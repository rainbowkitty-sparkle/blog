Dear readers, 

This morning I had my first induced OBE. After watching this [video] last night I had successful results. Last night I fell asleep around 4 am. I woke up at 8:30 am and stayed up for about 2 hours. In those 2 hours I went to the washroom, drank some water and ate some alfredo pasta. I went to bed sleeping on my back as I usually do so. My room was a bit bright from the sun so I placed a pillow over my head, covering my eyes. I remember dreaming of playing a video game and when the dream ended I had a [false-awakening]. In my false awakening, I was laying in my bed with my phone next to me. On my phone the video last night was playing and I could hear the sound in my head. I remembered my intention to astral project/OBE. I tried the following techniques to seperate my "spirit" from my body: the roll-over technique and the standing up method. The roll-over technqiue did not work for me but the standing up method did. I successfully popped out of my body. However, I felt hands over my eyes and I was only able to see out from the bottom of my peripherals. I procceded to walk over to the mirror in my room to look at myself. I bumped my head against the wall in the process then pressed my body against the mirror and felt the glass. I remember taking a moment in that experience to take the 'hands' away from my eyes but it didn't work. Then, I was woken up by a loud noise.

It was a successful OBE but a quite short one. It is still major progress. I hope to understand why my vision of obstructed in that experience and I hope for many more wonderful OBE experiences to share. 

Yours truly, 

Rainbowkitty Sparkle

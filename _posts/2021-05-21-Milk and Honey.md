## Did you know that milk and honey before bed can cause vivid dreams and even lucid dreams? 

Milk contains amino acids such as tryptophan and melatonin that induces vivid dreaming and helps the user fall asleep faster. Honey also contains the same properties that helps our brains release melatonon and tryptophan. I love honey and I love dreaming so this sounds like the perfect drink for me to have before bed. I think perhaps I was a bee in my past life... :honeybee:

## Constructing the Milk/Honey Drink

The first thing I did was to make sure to have my last meal 2 hours before going to bed and drinking my milk/honey mixture. This is to ensure that my body will produce and release the necessary tryptophan and melatonin while sleeping.

I took two table spoons of "Wild Flower Honey" while adding about a splash of hot water to my cup to dissolve the honey. This makes the honey mix into the milk better. Then I poured in 3% milk (also known as whole milk) into my cup. In my house I usually have whole milk, after doing some research I discovered that whole milk is one of the largest sources of tryptophan- a whooping 732 milligrams per quart! 

I drank about 300ml of the milk and honey mixture before going to bed. It was very sweet and delicious. I am not a big fan of milk but the honey made the milk very tolerable. :honey_pot:

## Will I think it will work? 

My answer is: Maybe? Perhaps? Not really. 

I am already a frequent dreamer and every night I can recall my dreams. My usual dreams that I have are so boring, they consist of the same people that I've seen in my life, places I have already been and doing things that I usually do in my life. I dislike having these mundane dreams and I'd rather take a nightmare over that. My favorite type of dreams are the weirder ones, I usually have this type of ones weekly. In my favorite type of dreams I'm in another person's body, in an other worldy place and I'm seeing things I have never seen before. It is very exciting for me when I have one of these dreams and I just never want to wake up. 

Another reason why I think it might not work is because of the honey. Most of the store-brand "honey" is just pathetic sugary corn syrup (yes I'm looking at you Billy Bees). The best type of honey I've had is raw honey and honeycombs from a local organic shop. Unfortunately for my milk/honey mixture I used a generic store brand honey. But it's still honey so perhaps it will do something. 

## Results of Day One

That night I had a hard time falling asleep. I was in bed at 1:30am and it took me about 2 and a half hours to fall asleep. When I woke up in the morning, recalled having dreams. I had two long dreams that night. However the dreams are too personal and intimate to share on here. But they weren't any dreams out of the ordinary, I would say they are mundane dreams. If I were to make this drink again, I'd drink more milk or use organic raw honey. 

In conclusion, I think the mixture did work or at least I did have a dream that night. Overall, I think that this type of mixture would be good for someone who does not have frequent dreams and would like to explore them. :thumbsup:

I recommend viewing this [video] to get started. I have had my first induced OBE after viewing it. Read about it [here]. If you don't wish to sit through the 1 hour video. I provided a quick summary of the video and key points taken from the [textbook] that was used and referenced in his lecture. All images included in this post were provided in the [textbook]. I highly reccommend to read _The Phase A Practical Guidebook by Michael Raduga_ for futher indepth information. You may [email] me and I will send you a copy if you wish. 

## What is The Phase?

![Image](/images/phase.JPG){:.border}

**The Phase** is described as the moment you are aware that you are dreaming. Others may use the term "_astral-projection_", "_out-of-body-experiences_" and "_lucid-dreaming_." I have found that all three of those term are all just the same thing because they all share a similar type of awareness. 

###### Entering the Phase is easier for individuals who have:
- [ ] Frequent recollection your dreams
- [ ] Lucid dreams
- [ ] Regularly sleep for 10 hours
- [ ] Good at visualizing 
- [ ] Overactive Imagination 

But this list doesn't rule anyone out from entering the Phase. This ability can be trained and taught to anyone.  

## How to Enter The Phase

The 4 summarized steps goes as follows:

1. Establish MEP plan
2. Enter the Phase with Indirect method
3. Follow MEP if previous step was successful 
4. Record your experience (even if it is unsuccessful)

#### Step 1: Establish MEP plan 

What is **MEP**? It means **Mirror, Eat, Personal Goal**. 

It is very important to set a game plan before entering the Phase as it will increase your success rate. MEP is an action plan that will help you remember your call to actions in the phase. 

Upon entering the phase the first thing you will do is find a mirror. Once you have accomplished that your next task is finding something to eat. Then the last part of the MEP plan is to do your personal goal to whatever you set it to! Make sure to come up with a personal goal before entering the phase. Your personal goal could be travelling to the stars, storming Area 51, visiting your lover's house, going to the White house or even meeting a deceased person.

#### Step 2: Entering the Phase:

The two methods that are used to enter the Phase are the **Direct method** and **Indirect method**. 

> The Indirect method - when you wake up and regardless of how much you slept, you try to exit the body 

The Indirect method is the "easiest method." It happens after sleeping and upon waking. One would perform concious actions upon awakening without movement. 

> The Direct method - when you lie down in bed and immediately try to exit the body 

The direct method is the much more difficult method for beginners because your body is in a waking state. However, the steps of the direct method are much more concrete and straightforward compared to the Indirect method. 

For the sake of simplicity, I am going to be explaining how to follow the Indirect method. 

### Entering the Phase with Indirect Method

![Image](/images/indirect.JPG){:.border}

1. **Wake up after you've had 6 hours of sleep** 
Once you've waken up be awake for at least an hour. In this period of time drink water, use the washroom, eat a snack containing carbs or sugar and re-read all instructions on entering the phase. _Note: Do not stay past an a certain time-limit if you know you can't fall asleep within the hour of the time you have waken up._ 

2. **Enter sleep with the intention of entering the Phase**
Upon entering sleep you must focus on the intention of entering the Phase. I usually imagine myself seperating myself from my body and repeating mantras to myself. During this step you usually sleep for 2-4 hours. The goal here is to fall asleep with the intention in hopes that you would enter an awakening with the intention in mind. 

3. **Separating upon each Natural Awakening** 
There are many different techniques to separate from your body. It is important you **cycle** between these different techniques until you have successfully split from your body. You must perform these techniques when you have awaken from sleep. Upon awakening remain **motionless**, **do not open your eyes** and **avoid listening to outside noise**. Remaining motionless is key when waking up because you do not want your body to switch to awake mode. 

Each technique listed here should be performed for 3-5 seconds. If nothing works you must go back to sleep and repeat everytime you wake up. This step will be repeated many times as each natural awakening occurs.

The techniques listed below are considered the best but you may chose to create your own if you wish to do so. 

**Observing Images:** Observe blank space before the eyes for 3-5 seconds and try to locate recognizable images or symbols. Do not focus on the details. The images should be _experiences_. The purpose of this technique is to become apart of that surrounding and the image becomes very realistic until separation from the body is achievable. 

**Swimmer's Technique:** Imagine vividly that you are swimming. Imagine making swimming motions with your arms, try to feel and recall the sensation of swimming. 

**Hand visualization:** Imagine vividly that you are rubbing your hands together. Recall the sensation, feeling and sound of your hands rubbing together. 

**Imagine Moving:** Imagine vividly that you are doing some sort of physical activity. This can be running, pulling a rope or even doing a gym routine. 

**Rotation:** Imagine your physical body rotating on an axis, similar to a rotisserie chicken or a swing set.

**Phantom wiggling:** Imagine that you are trying to move some part of your body without moving a muscle. 

_Note: Intense vibrations are common when exiting the body. Remain calm and try not to panic or else your physical body will wakeup._

### Creating your own Separation Technique 

Sometimes creating your own separation technique may help with your success in separation. These techniques can be categorized and be mixed. 

![Image](/images/phaseentrance.JPG){:.border}

> ***Examples of mixed techniques:***

> _Hand visualization: 1A, 3B, 2B, 2C_

> _Swimmer Technique: 3B, 5B, 5C_

Think about what you do repeatedly in your life on a daily basis. Pick something that is easy to visualize and recall in your head. If you play the piano frequently, try to imagine you are moving your fingers to press the keys without moving your muscles, recall the melody that is produced, the sensation of the sitting in the piano bench. This would be considered of a separation technique that is a hybrid of hearing and kinesthesia  

For example: I have my own separation technique that involves a hybrid of kinesthesia and hearing. I'd imagine myself pressing keys on my keyboard and clicking with my mouse visioning myself playing a video game that I enjoy. Eventually the sensations begin to feel so real and I end up in the Phase.

## How to know you're in the Phase? 

Did you really enter the Phase or were you just having a lucid dream? 

You have successfully entered the phase if you: 
- Had a sense of **awareness** 
- Recalled the sensation of feeling your body. _For example: you didn't feel yourself sleeping in your bed but you felt the sensation of walking around and using your body_

A main indication of **awareness** is realizing you had goals and carrying out the goals in the Phase. The difference from dreaming is that in a dream you'd be doing everything at once. 

Something that shouldn't be in the Phase: the sensation of lying in bed.

_Remember: If the sensations are too real, it cannot be a figment of your imagination in a dream._ 

## The Lift-Off :rocket: 

The steps may seem overwhelming or complicated but I can assure you this is real and everyone experiences it once in their life. There are so many different ways to enter the Phase. The reason why this specific tutorial works for beginners is because of it's practical and straightforward instructions. In the future I'd like to write about more about the phenomena of the Phase but I am still just a practicing dreamer. One thing I have learned from the inducing the Phase is that you cannot beat yourself down on your failures. Remember to keep a record everything. Keep trying and reflect on your failures. 

***3, 2, 1 - Lift off!~*** :rocket: 

Goodluck Astronaunts! :octocat:
